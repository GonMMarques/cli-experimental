### Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux / macOS

1. Define the following variable by OS:
   
   - Linux:
   
     ```bash
     export os="linux/amd64"
     ```
   
   - macOS with an Intel core:

     ```bash
     export os="darwin/amd64"
     ```
   
   - macOS with an Apple Silicon core:

     ```bash
     export os="darwin/arm64"
     ```
   
2. Download the latest release with the command:

    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -sL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/$os/kubectl"
    ```

    To download a specific version, replace the `$(curl -sL https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)` portion of the command with the specific version.

    For example, to download version v1.19.0 on Linux, type:
    
    ```bash
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.19.0/bin/$os/kubectl"
    ```

3. Make the kubectl binary executable.

    ```bash
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    ```

4. Move the binary in to your PATH.

    ```bash
    sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    ```
5. Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:

    ```bash
    kubectl version --client
    ```
